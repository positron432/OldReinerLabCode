# OldReinerLabCode

This code and sample files are to use python to analyze cluster data during my PhD at VCU. It is incomplete and will not finish its task. I don't know if I'll ever bother finishing the code now that I have finished my PhD and no longer work in the lab. I uploaded it here just in case I need it in the future for some reason.
